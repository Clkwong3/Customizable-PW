# Customizable-PW

A password generator is a great way to make unique and secure passwords for different apps while still keeping your personal info safe. It's a web-based tool that lets the user decide the length and type of characters in the password.

## Focus

Write a program that allow users to customize the password length and select which types of characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters) should be included. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user will be prompted to provide these preferences, and the generated password will be displayed accordingly. Given the starter code below, the focus of this project is JavaScript.

## Expectations

The user will see the password generator interface when opening the HTML file in a web browser. After clicking the "Generate Password" button and answering the required prompts, a random password will be displayed in the text area.

## Code Breakdown
