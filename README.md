# Customizable-PW

...Are you tired of trying to come up with distinctive passwords?..
...Can't remember which symbol or character could be used?..
...Build an application that makes a random password _for_ you!

## Description

Write a program that you can use to come up with a random password depending on what you decide. Given the starter code below, the focus of this project is JavaScript.

## Source of starter code

Friendly-Parakeet: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet

## Things to keep in mind

- **Arrays** can be used to store any data element, including letters and symbols.

- **Functions** define what you want; in this case, write a password and generate a password.

- **For loops** will check for specific conditions before running a block of code repeatedly as long as those conditions are met.

- **If conditions** will run a piece of code based on a specified condition once.
